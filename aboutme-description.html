<h1>Olivia is first and foremost an explorer.</h1> <p> When she's not discovering the great outdoors on a rock climbing, hiking or whitewater kayaking adventure she's exploring leading edge technologies and programming with new languages and APIs at school, work or hackathons across the country. She knows that computer programs have significant influences on people's lives, and understands the value of keeping the user in mind to ensure the impact is positive.

She is currently completing an interdisciplinary bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Psychology at Carleton University, hoping to bridge disciplines and come up with creative solutions in academia and in the industry. Olivia's first exposure to neural networks was during her research internship with Professor Jim Davies in the Science of Imagination Laboratory, and she continues to nurture her interest in Artificial intelligence in her studies. At IBM she gained technical experience working on a team in a large company and producing enterprise quality software solutions for a web application. Olivia is currently looking for co-op opportunities to attain a broader skill set and work with diverse teams while making a difference. Her goal is to effectively adapt her programming, psychology and communication skills to real world situations to help others.
